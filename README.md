# COMPFIS-II

This repository is for the simulations that I have done in the course of physics on Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, Introduction to Computational Physics II.

I am using python for now, but when I get better on other languages, I will try to make those simulations on them, or make another simulations with the theories that I used.

## Packages used

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/ "NumPy")
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/ "Matplotlib")
* [vpython.org](https://vpython.org "VPython")
