# Ordinary differential equation (ODE)

The methods used for numerical integration is Runge-Kutta.

* Euler (First-order)
* Runge-Kutta 2 (Second-order)
* Runge-Kutta 4 (fourth-order)

The main idea of the method is using a trial step at the midpoint of an interval to cancel out lower-order error terms. (For further information see in <https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Runge-KuttaMethod.html>)


## The formulas for each method is below

### Euler       ### Runge-Kutta 2       ### Runge-Kutta 4
